# Checks-a-74LS393-with-Arduino
This is my starting point... And later, I hope to be able to check ALL 74xx.



Arduino provides pulses to count to the pin digital IO 13 and will count these pulses with a variable (byte) in the software.
In the same time, at each pulse, Arduino will read the 8 bits with bit 2 to bit 9 and will compare to the software variable.
If different Arduino will send a message with the serial.
