# Checks-for-74LS393-with-Arduino
This is my starting point... And later, I hope to be able to check ALL 74xx.



Arduino provides pulses to the pin digital IO 13.
In the same time, at each pulse, Arduino will read the 8 bits from the counter with digital IO 2 to digital IO 9 and will compare to the software variable (byte).
If different Arduino will send a message to the serial.
